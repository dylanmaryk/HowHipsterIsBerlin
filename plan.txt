- Pull postcode polygons (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berlinermorgenpost/Berlin-Geodaten/master/berlin_postleitzahlen.topojson)
- Convert TopoJSON polygons to coordinate-based GeoJSON polygons (http://jeffpaine.github.io/geojson-topojson)
- Find center coordinates of each polygon (http://stackoverflow.com/a/3081078)
- Reverse geocode each coordinate to get postcode represented by each polygon (Google Maps Geocoding API)

- Search Foursquare for venues in Berlin by category (venues/search endpoint)
- For each venue, get postcode
- For each postcode, look for matching postcode in postcodes represented by polygons
- For a match, +1 to postcode represented by polygon

Result: Dictionary of postcodes to number of venues

README notes:
- Original GeoJSON converted from TopoJSON using tool
- Leaflet code from http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth
